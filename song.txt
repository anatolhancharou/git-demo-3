When I look at you
I can see the sadness in your eyes
In these desperate times
We get pushed and shoved from every side
I can't love you if you won't let me
Can't touch me if you don't try
I can feel you
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side
Love will keep us alive
Let's make the moment right
It's now or never
Love will keep us alive
Even the darkest night
Will shine forever
Love will keep us alive
